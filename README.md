# Health Care Premium Prediction

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting annual health care premiums using machine learning regression techniques. The model takes into account various features such as age, gender, income, and medical history to estimate the annual premium amount.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles categorical variables and medical history.
- **Normalization & Scaling**: Applies normalization and scaling based on age.
- **Regression Models**: Trains and evaluates various regression models.
- **Interactive Application**: Provides a Streamlit app for real-time predictions.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/health-care-premium-prediction.git
   cd health-care-premium-prediction
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Ensure you have Python 3.6+ and then install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Streamlit Application:**
   Start the application to input data and receive predictions:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app/app.py
   ```
